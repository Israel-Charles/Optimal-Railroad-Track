# Optimal-Railroad-Track
Java-based project that implements Kruskal's algorithm to build a cost-efficient railroad network connecting multiple cities. Given a list of tracks with associated costs, it identifies the minimum spanning tree, ensuring all cities are connected with the minimum possible total cost
